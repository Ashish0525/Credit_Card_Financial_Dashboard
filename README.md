# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard

**Overview:-**
This Power BI dashboard analyzes credit card transaction and customer data to uncover key business insights such as revenue performance, spending patterns, and customer behavior segmentation. The goal was to help financial analysts and decision-makers monitor KPIs effectively through dynamic, interactive visuals.

**The client wanted an interactive dashboard to:-**
-Track total revenue, amount, and interest earned.
-Understand customer spending patterns by card category and type.
-Compare quarterly and weekly trends in transaction activity.

One of the major **challenges** was handling a large, unstructured dataset containing millions of transaction records. To address this, I performed extensive data cleaning and transformation in Power Query, created data relationships, and developed custom DAX measures for KPIs like total revenue, transaction amount, and interest.

**Key Features:**
-Interactive filters (Gender, Quarter, Card Category, Week).
-Dynamic visuals: Line, bar, and combo charts.
-Insights segmented by Customer Job, Age, and Education.
-Drill-down functionality for deeper analysis.
-Modern UI with consistent color theme and readability focus.

**Tools Used:**
Power BI | Excel | DAX | Power Query

**Through this project, the client gained a clear, data-driven understanding of their customers, enabling smarter decision-making and better marketing targeting strategies.**
